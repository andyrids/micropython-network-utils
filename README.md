# MicroPython Package Repository - `mpy-connection`

NOTE: **WIP**

This is a repository for a MicroPython package named `connection`, which contains utility functions related to interfaces exposed by the [`network`](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/network.html#module-network) standard library and external packages on the [`micropython-lib`](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib) repository.

* `typing`: [micropython-stubs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Josverl/micropython-stubs/refs/heads/main/mip/typing.py)
* `typing_extensions`: [micropython-stubs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Josverl/micropython-stubs/refs/heads/main/mip/typing_extensions.py)

This repository is managed by Astral [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) Python package manager and can be installed by cloning the repository and syncing with uv.

```sh
git clone git@gitlab.com:micropython-iot-projects/libraries/mpy-connection.git
